# data_structures-fa2019
Code for a C++-based data structures course taken at UIUC in the Fall of 2019

Much of the code was supplied to students through github, and hence a significant portion of the code (roughly 80-90%) is not my work;
Often, the student's task was to write or complete the classes/methods within files of the form ____.cpp, ____.hpp or ____.h, and often
these types of assignments will also feature a file of the form ____given.cpp (or .hpp).
At my next opportunity I will comb through this repository and write a readme for each lap and mp to make clear which files represent
my own work and which files were provided to us.
