You start snooping around the room looking for the trapdoor he mentioned. You keep thinking someone's looking at you but when you turn around it's always just the baphomet statue. Eventually you find it over by the seating area. You move the seats and crack it open. The stench of death slowly wafts towards you. You're pretty squemish about that sort of thing and also dealing with some pretty heavy blood loss and probably an infection or two (we mentioned you were missing a kidney didn't we? Elon Musk took your kidney). You pass out and fall into the ditch. There probably wasn't an exit there anyway
