You decide to check out the altar. The surrounding area smells like that time you worked in a meat packaging plant one summer. Weird. You notice a map, conveniently illuminated by the shaft of light. The labels are as follows:
Altar: You are Here
Baphomet Statue: DO NOT LOOK AT EYES
Passageway 1: Exit
Seating Area
Pinball Machines: Broken
Vending Machines
Passageway 2: Sharks

What do?

# baphomet
go over and look that baphomet statue right in the eyes. Never trust Elon Musk!

# welllit
go down the passageway marked "Exit"

# pinball
play some pinball, you've earned it and you don't believe it's even broken, Elon Musk just doesn't want you to enjoy yourself while you succumb to septic shock. 

# vending
see if they've got anything decent in the vending machines

# poorlylit
try your luck in the passageway marked, unnervingly, "Sharks"
