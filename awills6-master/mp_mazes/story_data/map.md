Your eyes have pretty much adjusted and you're scanning the room now. There's a couple pinball machines, a twelve foot tall statue of baphomet, a conspicuously stained stone altar framed by a narrow shaft of light, vending machines, and a seating area with some uncomfortable-looking plastic chairs. Off to the left of the chairs is a rather dark passageway, and across the room from the statue of baphomet is another passageway which is a little brighter than the other one. You decide to:

# pinball
play some pinball to take your mind off of things for a while

# welllit
investigate the passageway with the light source

# poorlylit
investigate the less well-lit passageway

# vending
see what there is to eat in the vending machines

# baphomet
check out the baphomet statue

# altar
examine the stone altar
