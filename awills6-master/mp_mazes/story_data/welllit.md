You get up, feeling a serious sting from your torso as you do so, and start down the passageway with the better lighting. The light grows in intensity as you walk, as lights are wont to do when you get closer to their sources, and eventually said source comes into view: A door with an exit sign above it. You:

# exit
go through the door, obviously. You're pretty sure you're bleeding here.

# map
decide to turn back because it's just too obvious. Never trust Elon Musk!
