You fish out the chocolate bar you'd been saving. It feels pretty melted but you're still psyched. Hm. There's some crumpled paper in your pocket as well. It appears to be a note. After some time you remember you own a cell phone and luckily it seems to have retained some charge, although signal strength is (as might be expected in a subterranean cavern) not a thing. You read by the light of your phone: "Hey, Elon here. I've stranded you in my subterranean cave network, mostly just cuz but it should also help me get some data for a nascent pet project of mine. Smile for the camera! Anyway, I doubt you've eaten in a couple days so you should probably hurry up and get out of there. One of the passageways leading out of the room you're in should have a little more light than the others, I'd try that one if I were you. Definitely don't go through the trap-door. Good luck and whatnot." Seriously, why do you keep hanging out with him? Dude is legitimately certifiable. You're not sure whether to trust his advice or not...

# trapdoor
Never trust Elon Musk. Look for the trapdoor. Why would he even mention that?

# poorlylit
Never trust Elon Musk. You decide to go down the less-well-lit passageway.

# welllit
Against your better judgment, you decide to trust Elon and go down the comparatively better-lit passageway
