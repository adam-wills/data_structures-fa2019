You're a little tense and woozy and decide some pinball would be the best thing for you right now. No need to rush. It's not like... wait did you have kids? You can't seem to recall. Regardless, you go and check out the machines. There's one called "Scabies Defender" which has some extremely disconcerting grahics on the outside of the machine and another called "Escape from Elon's Basement. You decide to play the latter as it seems to speak to you and your situation very presciently. It's not broken because Elon Musk is a liar. You play for while, losing consciousness before you're able to win or lose. You die due to sepsis. We mentioned your kidney was hastily removed right? Well it was.
