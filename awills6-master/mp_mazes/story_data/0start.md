You wake up, covered in confetti and what seems to be animal feces, in a stone room or cave (semantics). It's damp and the smell is of the underground sort. Unseen things can be heard skittering occasionally around you past your radius of vision and you make no effort to see them. Your clothes are in a moderate state of disarray and a splitting headache prevents you from thinking about how you might have gotten there. "This again?" you ask of nobody in particular. "Augh. I have got to stop accepting Elon Musk's New Years party invitations." Which reminds you...

# chocolate
You've had a chocolate bar in your pocket for like, a really long time now. You should probably eat that.

# map
You've definitely been here before. This is the subterranean cave complex under Elon's mountaintop villa! You were involved in some sort of ceremony here last year, details of which are hazy. You remember a goat being involved though. There should be a map over by the altar somewhere if you can find it...

# organs
You've felt a searing pain in your midsection since you woke up, and now that you think about it your organs feel a little different from usual. You should take a look at that.
